	  <h1>How Did I Get Into Photography?</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/photo1.PNG" width="250" height="170" alt=""/><span style="font-family: neonoir, sans-serif; font-size: 16pt;">It started a couple years ago,</span> To be honest I really started it as I needed a hobby to do as I had decided to stop playing soccer and needed to find something to do. And after Drafting fell through, I now had the room to take a photography class! And that is pretty much it, nothing really more than that.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
	  <p>I really learned a lot through that class and am really glad I took it. I know like to take landscape shots as well as have fun editing photos using photoshop, which I also learned from taking a class.</p>

	  <h1>What Happened With Drafting?</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/tree.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="170" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, sans-serif; font-size: 16pt;">As I said earlier, I had some problems with Drafting that led to me dropping it.&nbsp; </span>Well for the longest time I had wanted to be an architect and had taken a class my Freshmen year. When Sophmore year came around there were some problems. The old teacher had to leave and we got a brand new one, but unfortunately it was his first time teaching. It was not the guys fault, but I was starting to gain some doubt in my career path and the poor experience I had with this new teacher led me to drop the idea of being an architect entirely.&nbsp;</p>

	  <h1>What Am I Up To Now?&nbsp;</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/future.jpg" width="250" height="170" alt=""/><span style="font-family: neonoir, sans-serif; font-size: 16pt;">Ever since Drafting fell through I put more of a focus on Math.&nbsp; </span>While it might seem weird I took up a career path in math despite the fact I enjoy photography, I am fine with it. I want to keep photography as a hobby, and want my actual life to more geared to what I feel I am really good at- Math. So now I am enrolled in multiple Calculus and Statistics classes and yes it is just as hard as you think it is, and yes I am stressing out. But, I think I'll make it, I always have in the past.</p>
